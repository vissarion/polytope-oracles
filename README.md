===

Library to assist in answering approximate membership and boundary 
queries on H-polytopes.

## Installation

First, you need to install some dependencies for debian/ubuntu linux:
```
apt-get install python3-distutils python3-dev
```

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to manage our dependencies. 


```bash
poetry install -E annoy
```
